Kobjects, Ksets, and Subsystems
===============================
kobject: holds the device model together

The tasks handled by struct kobject and its supporting code now include:
	(1) Reference counting of objects:
		tracking the lifecycle of such objects
	(2) Sysfs representation:
		sysfs -> kobject -> visible representation?
	(3) Data structure glue
	(4) Hotplug event handling
		netlink?

Kobject Basics
--------------
struct kobject + a long list of functions for manipulating them
<linux/kobject.h>

1. Embedding kobjects
How kobjects are used?
a. the functions handled by kobjects are all services performed on behalf of
other objects.
A kobject is of little interest on its own; it exists only to tie a higher-level
object into the device model.

b. kobjects are used to control access to a larger, domain-specific object.

kobjects are embedded in other structures.
 (a top-level, abstract class from which other classes are derived)

an example, struct cdev
finding its embedded kobject?
using the kobj field

given a struct kobject pointer, what is the pointer to the containing structure?
use the container_of macro

The way to convert a pointer to a struct kobject called kp embedded within a
struct cdev would be:
	struct cdev *device = container_of(kp, struct cdev, kobj);

2. Kobject initialization

(1) set the entire kobject to 0 -- memset
Often as part of the zeroing of the structure into which the kobject is embedded.
(2) set up some of the internal fields with a call to kobject_init( ):
	void kobject_init(struct kobject *kobj);
(3) at a minimum, set the name of the kobject; this is the name that is used in sysfs entries.
	int kobject_set_name(struct kobject *kobj, const char *format, ...);
	it is actually possible for this operation to fail (it may try to allocate
	memory), should check the return value and react accordingly.
(4) The other kobject fields that should be set by the creator are ktype, kset, and parent.

3. Reference count manipulation

	struct kobject *kobject_get(struct kobject *kobj);
	void kobject_put(struct kobject *kobj);

	The existence of a kobject (and its containing structure) may well, for example,
	require the continued existence of the module that created that kobject.

	struct kobject *cdev_get(struct cdev *p)
	{
		struct module *owner = p->owner;
		struct kobject *kobj;
		if (owner && !try_module_get(owner))
			return NULL;
		kobj = kobject_get(&p->kobj);
		if (!kobj)
			module_put(owner);
		return kobj;
	}

	Creating a reference to a cdev structure requires creating a reference also to
	the module that owns it. So cdev_get uses try_module_get to attempt to increment
	that module’s usage count.

4. Release functions and kobject types
what happens to a kobject when its reference count reaches 0?
the code that created the kobject must be notified asynchronously whenever the
last reference to one of its kobjects goes away.

This notification is done through a kobject’s release method.

void my_object_release(struct kobject *kobj)
{
	struct my_object *mine = container_of(kobj, struct my_object, kobj);
	/* Perform any additional cleanup on this object, then... */
	kfree(mine);
}

every kobject must have a release method, and the kobject must persist
(in a consistent state) until that method is called.

the release method is not stored in the kobject itself; instead, it is
associated with the type of the structure that contains the kobject.
This type is tracked with a structure of type struct kobj_type -- “ktype.”
struct kobj_type {
	void (*release)(struct kobject *);
	struct sysfs_ops *sysfs_ops;
	struct attribute **default_attrs;
};

Every kobject needs to have an associated kobj_type structure. The
kobj_type pointer can be found in two different places. T
	(1) The kobject structure itself contains a field (called ktype)
	(2) (If this kobject is a member of a kset,) provided by that kset instead.

	the macro:
	struct kobj_type *get_ktype(struct kobject *kobj);
	finds the kobj_type pointer for a given kobject.
